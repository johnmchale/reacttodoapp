# Simple React Todo App

This is a simple React Todo App that uses a number of react concepts including Hooks (useState, UseEffect, useRef), LocalStorage and basic CSS styling.

It is mainly based on the application described in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQAHSlTtcmY&t=6s

It is a good beginner learning project. Check out the video for explanation, though this project adds a few extras.

## Installation 

Once the project has been cloned, you can install it (to add node modules) and run it by entering the following commands:

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
